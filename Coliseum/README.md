# Coliseum
A tool to help directly involve your streaming audience in your content.

#### Here's How it Works

###### Streamers Stream.

1. Streamers open up a Coliseum for their viewers.
2. The Streamer who opened the Coliseum becomes the Gladiator.
3. Gladiators typically do whatever the hell the Emperor says.
4. Fortunately for them, the Emperor's ideas all come from the Viewers.
5. Every Gladiator has an amount of Favor associated with them. This keeps track of how well the Gladiator listens to their audience.
5. If the Gladiator follows the Emperor's advice, great! They gain favor!
6. If they don't? Their favor goes down. Boo, hiss. Bah Humbug. Choose your favorite insult.

###### Viewers Participate.

1. Find your favorite streamer. They may provide you a direct link. You may find them through a search page on Coliseum. Who knows?
2. You'll see two lists of ideas. One is the "Thumbed" list. The other is the "Shouted" list.
3. The Shouted List is ever-changing. Any viewer can "Shout" out an idea for the streamer to do. These ideas are placed within the list after approval and voted on.
4. When a Viewer Shouts an idea, the entire viewerbase will be called to approve it. If an idea gets a majority approval within 10 seconds, it is placed into the Shouted List.
3. Every once in awhile you'll be called to vote on the items in the Thumbed List. The result of this vote will be suggested to the streamer. 
6. The runner-up idea will be kept. The rest will be discarded and replaced with the top 4 items in the Shouted List. The Shouted List will then be scrapped.
